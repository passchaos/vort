# EROFS

Vort provides a pure Zig EROFS reader and deterministic writer for the
filesystem format used by Android, embedded Linux, and container images.

The reader validates the superblock, CRC-32C checksum, block geometry,
incompatible feature bits, compact and extended inode layouts, directory entry
ordering, names, NIDs, and exact allocation limits. Flat plain and flat inline
files, directories, regular files, and symbolic links are supported. Bounded
xattr decoding covers inline entries, shared IDs relative to `xattr_block`,
empty values, standard full-name/user/POSIX-ACL/trusted/lustre/security name
indexes, and incompatible-feature long indexes backed by bounded plain prefix
tables. Reconstructed names and values are copied into one owned buffer; count
and aggregate-byte limits are checked before allocation.

Compressed files support both legacy full indexes and modern compact indexes,
including four-byte and sixteen-entry/two-byte packs, HEAD/NONHEAD lookback,
EOF sentinels, and big pclusters. LZ4, raw Deflate, and Zstandard extents are
decoded, as are exact-size MicroLZMA extents with inverted property bytes,
8 MiB EROFS dictionary bounds, exact compressed-input consumption, and range
termination validation. MicroLZMA is handled as its own wire format rather than
being substituted with LZMA-Alone.

The writer emits 4 KiB filesystems with compact inodes, CRC-32C-protected
superblocks, dot-omitted sorted directories, nested and empty directories,
symbolic links, flat plain/inline stored data, and legacy full compression
indexes. LZ4, raw Deflate, and Zstandard modes encode every non-empty
regular-file logical cluster into an independently addressable physical cluster.
Compressed payloads are right-aligned with `lz4_0padding`; a `PLAIN` index is
used whenever compression would not reduce the payload. Deflate and Zstandard
images include their required superblock compression-configuration records.
Each entry and the root directory can carry deterministic inline xattrs; inode
planning accounts for their ibodies before flat-inline tails and aligned
compression headers. `xattr_prefixes` optionally writes a plain prefix table
and uses its caller-ordered first match without changing the default wire.
Identical entries and options produce identical images.

Writer entries use safe relative paths. Missing parent directories are created
automatically, while absolute paths, empty components, `.`/`..`, NUL bytes,
duplicate entries, and non-directory parents are rejected. Entry data and
symlink targets remain caller-owned for the duration of `encodeErofsAlloc`.

```zig
const config_xattrs = [_]vort.ErofsXattr{
    .{ .name = "user.owner", .value = "vort" },
};
const root_xattrs = [_]vort.ErofsXattr{
    .{ .name = "user.image", .value = "system" },
};
const image = try vort.encodeErofsAlloc(allocator, &.{
    .{ .path = "etc/config", .data = "enabled=true\n", .xattrs = &config_xattrs },
    .{ .path = "var/empty", .kind = .directory },
    .{ .path = "config-link", .kind = .symlink, .target = "etc/config" },
}, .{
    .compression = .zstandard,
    .root_xattrs = &root_xattrs,
    .xattr_prefixes = &.{"user."},
});
defer allocator.free(image);

const archive = try vort.parseErofs(image);
const inode = try archive.lookup(allocator, "etc/config", 1024, 1024 * 1024);
var attributes = try archive.readXattrsAllocLimited(allocator, inode, 32, 64 * 1024);
defer attributes.deinit();
const owner = attributes.find("user.owner").?.value;
```

Chunk-based files, external devices, 48-bit addressing, packed fragments,
metaboxes, and compressed tail packing remain future work. Prefix tables stored
inside packed-fragment or metabox inodes remain unsupported along with those
layouts; ordinary `PLAIN_XATTR_PFX` tables are supported in both directions.
The writer does not yet deduplicate repeated values into the optional
shared-xattr region.

```sh
zig build run -- list-erofs-file system.erofs
zig build run -- create-erofs-file output.erofs path/in/image input.bin zstd
zig build run -- extract-erofs-file system.erofs etc/config output.conf 67108864
zig build run -- list-erofs-xattrs system.erofs etc/config
zig build run-erofs-diff
```

CI builds a pinned `erofs-utils` reference and generates plain, compact/full
LZ4, MicroLZMA, Deflate, and Zstandard images when the reference has a recent
XZ Utils. `fsck.erofs` validates and extracts those images before Vort performs
independent listing and byte-for-byte extraction.
The same gate generates Vort stored, LZ4, raw Deflate, and Zstandard images
twice to prove determinism, self-decodes their nested tree, and has `fsck.erofs`
extract their regular files, incompressible `PLAIN` fallbacks, symlink, and empty
directory. Real `user.*` attributes include repeated values that erofs-utils
promotes to shared entries; an additional reference image combines shared
values with a long prefix table. Vort reads those images, while
`fsck.erofs --xattrs` restores long-prefix Vort-authored root, file, and
directory attributes.
